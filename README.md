Bitcore Node Flux
============

A Flux full node for building applications and services with Node.js. A node is extensible and can be configured to run additional services. Additional services can be enabled to make a node more useful such as exposing new APIs, running a block explorer and wallet service.

## Configuration

Bitcore includes a Command Line Interface (CLI) for managing, configuring and interfacing with your Bitcore Node.

```bash

cd mynode
bitcore-node install <service>
bitcore-node install https://github.com/yourname/helloworld
