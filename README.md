Bitcore Node BitCore
============

A BitCore full node for building applications and services with Node.js. A node is extensible and can be configured to run additional services. At the minimum a node has an interface to ~~[Bitcoin Core with additional indexing](https://github.com/bitpay/bitcoin/tree/0.12.1-bitcore)~~ for more advanced address queries. Additional services can be enabled to make a node more useful such as exposing new APIs, running a block explorer and wallet service.

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BTXinsight/bitcore-node-btx.git
cd bitcore-node-btx
npm install
bitcore-node start
```

## Prerequisites

- GNU/Linux x86_32/x86_64, or OSX 64bit *(for bitcored distributed binaries)*
- Node.js v0.10, v0.12 or v4
- ZeroMQ *(libzmq3-dev for Ubuntu/Debian or zeromq on OSX)*
- ~30GB of disk storage
- ~2GB of RAM

## Configuration

Bitcore includes a Command Line Interface (CLI) for managing, configuring and interfacing with your Bitcore Node.

```bash
bitcore-node create -d <bitcoin-data-dir> mynode
cd mynode
bitcore-node install <service>
bitcore-node install https://github.com/yourname/helloworld
```

This will create a directory with configuration files for your node and install the necessary dependencies. For more information about (and developing) services, please see the [Service Documentation](docs/services.md).
